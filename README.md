# My NixOS Modules

My NixOS Modules hosted on my personal Git Server. Feel free to look around. Be aware that not all configuration files are available in my public repository.

## Overview

This repository provides my personal templates for `NixOS` and `home-manager` as NixOS module. For an declarative reproducible system we use the following tools:

- [**NixOS**](https://nixos.org/): Linux distribution based on Nix to provide a declarative and reproducible system.
- [**sops-nix**](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix): Inline secret provisioning for NixOS based on SOPS.
- [**agenix**](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix): Encrypted file provisioning for NixOS based on age.
- [**disko**](https://github.com/nix-community/disko): Declarative reproducible system partitioning.
- [**nixos-anywhere**](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere): Initial setup/deployment via ssh.
- [**deploy-rs**](https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs): Multi-profile Nix-flake deploy tool.
- [**vault**](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault): Self-hosted secret management.
